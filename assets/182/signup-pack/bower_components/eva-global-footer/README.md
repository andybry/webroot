#Eva Global Footer

##General Integration

###HTML

There are two files in the root of this repository, demo-footer.html and global-footer.html

demo-footer illustrates an implementation of the global footer, global footer is the code on it's own.

###SCSS/CSS

Similarly, there are two files for SCSS / CSS, a demo called demo-footer.scss and global-footer.scss.

The demo file lists and illustrates the footer's dependencies
